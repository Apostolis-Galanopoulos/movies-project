## Missing bits

2. Movie Details Page
    b. This page must be opened into a popup
3. Movies Collections Page
    c. By clicking to a collection a new page should open with the list of collection movies from where user can remove a movie from the collection or see the movie details using MovieDetailsPage mentioned above.
    d. User can add one or more movies to a collection by selecting the movies from the search results (SearchPage), then a popup should be opened with all the collections and user should select in which collection to add the selected movies.
    ** instead of the pop-up, there is an drop-down menu
